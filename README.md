# üöÄ LLM Fine-tuning Playground: Demystifying Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
Welcome to the LLM Fine-tuning Playground! This repository is designed to be a comprehensive and accessible resource for understanding and implementing various Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs).

Whether you're a machine learning engineer, data scientist, researcher, or an AI enthusiast, this repository aims to demystify the complexities of LLM fine-tuning by providing clear, step-by-step explanations and reproducible code examples.

‚ú® Why This Repository?
Fine-tuning LLMs can be resource-intensive and often involves navigating a maze of techniques and configurations. This project aims to:

Demystify PEFT: Break down complex concepts like LoRA, QLoRA, and other PEFT methods into easily digestible explanations.

Provide Hands-On Examples: Offer practical, runnable code in both Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and Python script (.py) formats.

Ensure Reproducibility: Provide detailed environment setup instructions to help you run the code seamlessly on your own machine.

Facilitate Learning: Each example comes with extensive comments and Markdown descriptions, explaining why certain steps are taken and what the underlying principles are.

Showcase Best Practices: Demonstrate effective ways to prepare data, configure models, and train LLMs efficiently.

üåü Features & Highlights
Diverse PEFT Methods: Explore implementations of:

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** Fine-tuning by injecting small, trainable matrices.

**QLoRA (Quantized LoRA):** Combining LoRA with 4-bit quantization for extreme memory efficiency.

(Future additions might include Prompt Tuning, P-Tuning, Adapters, etc.)

**Step-by-Step Guidance:** Every notebook and script is heavily commented and includes detailed explanations of:

- Data preparation and formatting.

- Model loading and quantization.

- PEFT configuration (LoraConfig).

- Training loop setup (e.g., using Hugging Face Trainer).

- Evaluation metrics and interpretation.

**Reproducible Environments:** A dedicated environment.yml (or requirements.txt) file for each major section ensures you can easily set up the exact environment used for the code.

**Practical Use Cases:** Examples are designed to be practical and adaptable to your own LLM fine-tuning projects.

Clear Code Structure: Organized folders make it easy to navigate and find specific examples.
