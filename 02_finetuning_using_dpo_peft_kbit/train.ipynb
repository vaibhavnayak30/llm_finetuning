    "# What is DPO ?\n",
    "- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, offering a simpler and more stable alternative to traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).\n",
    "- Pre-trained LLMs are excellent at predicting the next token based on vast amounts of text. However, they don't inherently know what humans prefer in terms of helpfulness, harmlessness, style, or specific content. This is where \"alignment\" comes in â€“ teaching the model to generate outputs that are more desirable to humans.\n",
    "- DPO's key innovation is that it eliminates the need for a separate reward model and complex reinforcement learning algorithms. Instead, it directly optimizes the language model's policy based on human preferences, treating it as a binary classification problem."
